# Things to Add

- The `--input` argument should be used in score mode to specify the input feedback file (not just create mode).
- `--input` should not be required for delete mode.
- Encryption of pdf files.
- Allow user to provide names of output text files.
- If empty (or partially empty) feedback file is provided in score mode, warn instead of crashing.
- Update usage.
- There should be a slick way of deducting points from late submitters.
- Since the Physics Department wants all TAs to submit timesheets, add time mode to keep track of hours spent on grading. Additionally, broadcast audio reminders to get up and take a break.
